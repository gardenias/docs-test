Installing and Configuring Extensions
=====================================

A vanilla install of Mercurial does not have many features. This is an
intentional choice by Mercurial to keep the base install simple and free
of foot guns.

Installing Extensions
=====================

To install an extension, you'll need to add a line to your Mercurial
configuration file.

As a user, you care about the following configuration files:

1. Your global hgrc
2. A per-repository hgrc

Your user-global configuration file is ``~/.hgrc``. Settings in this
file apply to all ``hg`` commands you perform everywhere on your system
(for your current user).

Each repository that you clone or initialize has an optional
``.hg/hgrc`` file that provides repository-specific configurations.

Mercurial starts by loading and applying settings from global
configuration files and then overlays configurations from each
lesser-scoped files.

.. tip::

   To learn more about Mercurial configuration files, run ``hg help
   config``.

To install an extension, you add a line under the ``[extensions]``
section of a config file like the following::

  [extensions]
  foo=path/to/extension

This is saying *activate the **foo** extension whose code is present at
**path/to/extension***.

Core Extensions That Almost Everyone Wants
==========================================

Mercurial ships with a number of built-in extensions. Of these, every
user will almost always want to install the following extensions:

color
   This extension adds colorized output to commands, making output
   easier to read.
fsmonitor
   Monitor the filesystem for changes using so operations querying
   filesystem state complete faster.

.. important::

   fsmonitor is highly recommended when interacting with the Firefox
   repository. It will make Mercurial commands faster.

pager
   Enable command output to go to a pager (such as less).
progress
   Show progress bars during long-running operations.

   (``progress`` was moved to Mercurial's core and is enabled by default
   in Mercurial 3.5+.)

Since core extensions are bundled with Mercurial, they have a special
syntax that makes them easier to install::

  [extensions]
  color=
  pager=

Core Extensions to Perform History Rewriting
============================================

Out of the box, Mercurial only allows commits operations to be additive.
If you make a mistake, the solution is to create a new commit that fixes
it. You can't rewrite old commits. You can't change the order of
existing commits. You can't change the shape of the DAG of the commits.

These operations all have something in common: they rewrite history.

.. note::

   Mercurial doesn't allow history rewriting by default because it is a
   major foot gun for people new to version control. A potential
   side-effect of history rewriting is data loss or confusion due to
   loss of state. Mercurial believes that these risks should be opt-in
   and has thus shipped without any history rewriting features enabled
   by default.

Mercurial ships with a number of built-in extensions that enable history
rewriting:

histedit
   Enables the ``hg histedit`` command, which brings up a text editor
   listing commits, allowing you to change order and specify actions to
   perform.

   The functionality is roughly equivalent to ``git rebase -i``.
rebase
   Enables the ``hg rebase`` command, which allows you to splice commits
   across different chains in the DAG.
strip
   Enables you to delete changesets completely.

Core Extensions to Enable Different Workflows
=============================================

Mercurial ships with some extensions that enable alternate workflows.
These include:

shelve
   Enables uncommitted work to be saved to a standalone file without
   being committed to the repository.

3rd Party Extensions You Should Highly Consider
===============================================

chg
---

`chg <https://bitbucket.org/yuja/chg/>`_ is a C wrapper for the ``hg``
command. Typically, when you type ``hg``, a new Python process is created,
Mercurial is loaded, and your requested command runs and the process exits.

With ``chg``, a Mercurial *command server* background process is created
that runs Mercurial. When you type ``chg``, a C program connects to that
background process and executes Mercurial commands.

**chg can drastically speed up Mercurial.** This is because the overhead
for launching a new Python process is high (often over 50ms) and the
overhead for loading Mercurial state into that process can also be high.
With ``chg``, you may this cost once and all subsequent commands
effectively eliminate the Python and Mercurial startup overhead. For
example::

   $ time hg --version
   real    0m0.118s
   user    0m0.100s
   sys     0m0.015s

   $ time chg --version
   real    0m0.012s
   user    0m0.000s
   sys     0m0.004s

   $ time hg export
   real    0m0.137s
   user    0m0.093s
   sys     0m0.042s

   $ time chg export
   real    0m0.034s
   user    0m0.000s
   sys     0m0.004s

Here, we see ~100ms wall time improvement with chg activated. That may not
sound likea lot, but you will notice.

Additional 3rd Party Extensions to Consider
===========================================

evolve
------

The `evolve extension <https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/EvolveExtension>`_
opens up new workflows that harness Mercurial's ability to record how
changesets *evolve* over time.

Typically, when history is rewritten, new commits are created and the old
ones are discarded. With the ``evolve`` extension enabled, Mercurial intsead
hides the old commits and writes metadata holding the relationship between
old and new commits. This metadata can be transferred between clients,
allowing clients to make intelligent decisions about how to recover from
rewritten history. For example, if a force push is performed, a client
will now exactly what rebase to perform to mimic what was done elsewhere.

The ``evolve`` extension also enables useful Mercurial commands such as
``hg previous``, ``hg next``, and ``hg amend`` (which is a shortcut for
``hg commit --amend``).

githelp
-------

Are you a Git user learning Mercurial for the first time? The
`githelp extension <https://bitbucket.org/facebook/hg-experimental/>`_
adds a ``hg githelp`` command that suggests Mercurial equivalent
commands from Git commands. Just type a Git command and learn how to
use Mercurial!

Mozilla Centric Extensions
==========================

In addition to the many :ref:`extensions <hgext>` in this repository, you
should also consider the following.

trychooser
----------

The `trychooser extension <https://bitbucket.org/sfink/trychooser>`_ helps
with the process of submitting to Try (Mozilla's special repository that
kicks off automation build and test jobs from submitted code).

In addition to helping you select a trychooser syntax, this extension also
manages the temporary commit required to hold that syntax. This means
less typing to get your repository in order to send things to Try.
