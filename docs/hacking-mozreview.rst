Hacking MozReview
=================

Want to improve MozReview? This article will help you get started.

Before we begin, let's introduce the components that make up MozReview.

Review Board
   Django-based code-review software.

Mercurial Server
   Code reviews are initiated by pushing them to a Mercurial repository.

Bugzilla
   Review Board actions result in interaction with Bugzilla.

mozreview
   A Review Board extension providing integration with the rest of the
   MozReview system, including user interface modifications and
   autoland and Bugzilla support.

rbbz
   A Review Board extension that integrates Review Board with
   Bugzilla. The code here is slowly being migrated to the mozreview
   extension, so rbbz should be considered deprecated.

Review Board Mercurial Extension
   There exist client-oriented and server-oriented Mercurial extensions
   to enable Mercurial peers to exchange and interface with review data.

Running a MozReview Instance
============================

It is possible to run a fully isolated, fully local MozReview instance
from your machine. This will give you an environment that should behave
like production.

You will need to install the dependencies listed :ref:`here <devguide_environment>`.

You will also need Docker installed. On Linux, this is generally as simple
as installing the required package, e.g., on Ubuntu::

  $ sudo apt-get install docker.io

You can also install the very latest release `directly from Docker <http://docs.docker.com/linux/step_one/>`_.

On Linux, it is necessary to configure Docker to listen on a tcp socket
rather than the default configuration, which uses an unix domain socket,
in order to get test results which match the expected results. This can be
done by editing your configuration file (in ``/etc/default/docker`` for
Ubuntu 14.04, see `the docs <https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/systemd/#custom-docker-daemon-options>`_
for more details) to start docker with the following option::

  -H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375

You will also need to set the ``DOCKER_HOST`` variable::

  $ export DOCKER_HOST=127.0.0.1:2375

For OS X, you will need to install and start up docker-machine; see
the official `installation instructions
<https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/>`_.  Make sure you specify
more than the default 1024 MB of RAM, which is insufficient for a
local MozReview installation, given the number of containers that are
created.  If you're using VirtualBox as your driver, this should work
(creating a docker machine called "default")::

  docker-machine create --driver virtualbox --virtualbox-memory 4096 default

Some MozReview developers have experienced stability problems using Virtualbox
and have found that using VMWare as the docker-machine driver results in a
better development experience.  If you are setting repeated errors from Docker
when creating a local environment or running tests, consider switching to
VMWare.

Running a local MozReview instance in Windows is not yet supported,
but if you get it working, please :ref:`let us know! <mozreview_getting_in_touch>`

After you have docker up and running, you'll need to configure your
environment. Run the following::

  $ ./create-test-environment

This will create a virtualenv in ``venv/`` with all the necessary
package dependencies. It will also create Docker images for running
Bugzilla. This could take 10-20 minutes to run the first time you run
the command (most of the time is spent creating the Bugzilla Docker
image).

Now, you can create and start a MozReview instance::

  $ ./mozreview start /path/to/instance
  ...
  waiting for Bugzilla to start
  Bugzilla accessible on http://192.168.59.104:55568/
  Bugzilla URL: http://192.168.59.104:55568/
  Review Board URL: http://192.168.59.104:55569/
  Mercurial URL: http://192.168.59.104:55570/
  Pulse endpoint: 192.168.59.104:55573
  Autoland URL: http://192.168.59.104:55574/
  Admin username: admin@example.com
  Admin password: password
  LDAP URI: ldap://192.168.59.104:55571/
  HG Push URL: ssh://192.168.59.104:55572/

  Run the following to use this instance with all future commands:
    export MOZREVIEW_HOME=/Users/gps/tmp/mozreview

  Refresh code in the cluster by running:
    ./mozreview refresh

  Perform refreshing automatically by running:
    ./mozreview autorefresh

  (autorefresh requires `watchman`)

  Obtain a shell in a container by running:
    ./mozreview shell <container>

  (valid container names include: rbweb, bmoweb, hgrb, autoland)

.. hint::

   There is a helper script which will automatically create users, bugs, and
   a repository, as well as a local clone of the repository that is
   ready to push::

    $ ./start-local-mozreview

   This will use ``../mozreview-test`` as the instance path, and
   locally clone the repository to ``../local-mozreview-test-repo``.

You should be able to load the printed URLs in your browser and see a
working site. If you don't, `file a bug! <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=MozReview&component=Testing%20%2F%20Development%20Environment>`_

.. warning::

   Storing MozReview instances inside a Mercurial repository will
   introduce many untracked files. It is recommended to store your
   instances outside of a repository checkout.

.. hint::

   All ``mozreview`` commands take a positional argument defining the
   path to the instance they should operate on. If you define the
   ``MOZREVIEW_HOME`` environment variable, you do not need to define
   this argument.

   The remainder of this document assumes this environment variable
   is defined.

Creating Users
--------------

There are two primary account systems inside the MozReview cluster:
Bugzilla and LDAP.

Bugzilla accounts provide authentication and authorization for
web properties, including Bugzilla, MozReview, and Autoland.

LDAP accounts hold information needed to communicate with the
Mercurial SSH server. When LDAP accounts are created, an SSH keypair
is associated with the account. The public key is added to LDAP so SSH
logins may be validated.

The two account systems are completely separate.

Review Board also has its own account system. But it is linked
to Bugzilla's user database and should be thought of an extension
rather than a separate account system.

Creating Universal Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In many scenarios, it is acceptable to create an account in both
systems. We call these *universal users* because they exist everywhere.

The way to do this is with the ``mozreview create-user`` command::

   $ ./mozreview create-user user1@example.com password 'Example User' \
       --uid 2000 --scm-level 1 --bugzilla-group editbugs

This creates the ``user1@example.com`` user with password ``password``
and full name ``Example User``. The LDAP account says to use UID
``2000`` and give the user access level 1. Finally, the user is added to
the ``editbugs`` Bugzilla group, which gives the user permission to edit
bugs.

A SSH keypair for the user is created and configured with LDAP.

Creating LDAP Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you would like to create a user in LDAP without a corresponding
Bugzilla user (this is rare), you can use the
``mozreview create-ldap-user`` command. e.g.::

   $ ./mozreview create-ldap-user gszorc@mozilla.com gps 2002 'Gregory Szorc' --key-file ~/.ssh/id_rsa --scm-level 3

Here, we create the account ``gszorc@mozilla.com`` with system user
name ``gps`` with user ID ``2`` with name ``Gregory Szorc`` with an
existing RSA SSH keypair and with level 3 source code access.

.. note::

   When specifying an existing key file, the public key will be
   added to the LDAP server running in the cluster. Your private key
   remains as a secret on your local machine.

Creating Bugzilla Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you would like to create a user in Bugzilla without a corresponding
LDAP user, you can use ``mozreview create-user`` without the
``--uid`` argument. e.g.::

   $ ./mozreview create-user me@example.com password 'Joe Smith'

Creating Repositories
---------------------

MozReview instances are initially empty. They don't have any
repositories you can push to.

To create an empty repository to hold reviews, use ``mozreview``::

   $ ./mozreview create-repo repo_name
   HTTP URL (read only): http://192.168.59.104:55570/repo_name
   SSH URL (read+write): ssh://192.168.59.104:55572/repo_name

   Run the following to create a configured clone:
     ./mozreview clone repo_name /path/to/clone

   And a clone bound to a particular user:
     ./mozreview clone repo_name /path/to/clone --user <user>

Pushing to repositories is done via SSH, as this is how production
works.

Creating Configured Repository Clones
-------------------------------------

It is common to want to configure a local repository clone to talk to a
review repository from your local MozReview cluster. The ``mozreview
clone`` command exists to make creating one simple::

   $ ./mozreview clone repo_name /path/to/dest

The ``hgrc`` of the created repository will be configured such that the
repository is *bound* to the MozReview instance it came from.

Passing the ``--user`` argument to the ``clone`` command will further
bind the repository to a specific user. When used, ``hg push`` commands
will automatically use the appropriate SSH key and username.

Configuring a Hosting Service for a Repository
----------------------------------------------

Using Autoland functionality from within MozReview requires configuring a
hosting service for your test repository. The hosting service contains the
try repository URL, the landing repository URL

You will need to login as the admin user in your reviewboard instance. To
avoid the bugzilla login, visit ``/admin`` in your browser. Once logged in,
click on ``Repositories`` and then the name of your repo, e.g. ``test-repo``.
Copy the current URL and then click on ``Hosting Service`` and select the
``hmo`` hosting service.

Enter a username for the hosting service, paste the URL to the repository in
the ``Repository URL`` field. Enter ``try`` into the ``Try Repository URL``
field will work for local testing with Autoland.

You should end up with something like the following:

.. image:: hosting-service.png


Refreshing Code
---------------

Because processes are running inside Docker containers and are operating
on copies of code, changes to the source code in your working directory
will not automatically take effect in running processes.

To refresh code running on the cluster, run the ``refresh``
sub-command::

   $ ./mozreview refresh

The ``autorefresh`` command can be used to start a file watching
daemon that will automatically refresh the cluster when local files
are changed::

   $ ./mozreview autorefresh

.. tip::

   Use of ``autorefresh`` is highly recommended when doing development,
   as it will save you the overhead of having to manually type a refresh
   command every time you change something.

Stopping the Servers
--------------------

When you run ``mozreview start``, a number of Docker containers and
daemon processes will be started. These will linger forever - taking up
system resources - until there is some form of intervention.

The easiest way to stop everything related to the running MozReview
instance is to run ``mozreview stop``. e.g.::

   $ ./mozreview stop

Exporting Environment Variables
-------------------------------

Many support tools (``bugzilla``, ``reviewboard``, etc) look for magic
environment variables to configure things like what server to talk to.

The ``shellinit`` sub-command can be used to mass export all variables
defining how a MozReview cluster works::

   $ $(./mozreview shellinit)

Interacting with Bugzilla
=========================

The ``bugzilla`` tool in the root of the repository provides a quick an
convenient interface to performing common Bugzilla operations, such as
creating bugs and printing the state of bugs.

This tool has the dual role of supporting both machines and humans. The
tests rely heavily on this tool to perform small, well-defined Bugzilla
interactions. You are encouraged to use the tool to help you hack on
MozReview.

Since the tool had its origins in testing land, it currently requires
environment variable(s) to define which Bugzilla instance to use.

If you have the ``MOZREVIEW_HOME`` variable set, the Bugzilla instance
associated with that MozReview instance is used. Else, you will need to
define the following variables:

BUGZILLA_URL
   This must be set the base URL of the Bugzilla instance you wish to
   communicate with.
BUGZILLA_USERNAME
   The username your API requests to Bugzilla will use.
BUGZILLA_PASSWORD
   The password your API requests to Bugzilla will use.

Interacting with Review Board
=============================

The ``reviewboard`` tool in the root of the repository provides a
mechanism to perform well-defined interactions with Review Board
instances. You are encouraged to use the tool to help you hack on
MozReview.

The tool had its origins in testing code, so its human interface could
use some love.

You'll need to define your Review Board credentials through environment
variables: ``BUGZILLA_USERNAME`` and ``BUGZILLA_PASSWORD``. The name
*bugzilla* is in there because MozReview shares its user database with
Bugzilla.

Code Locations
==============

``pylib/rbbz`` contains the modifications to Review Board to enable
Bugzilla integration and support for series of reviews.

``pylib/mozreview`` contains the UI modifications to Review Board.

``hgext/reviewboard`` contains the client and server Mercurial
extensions.

``pylib/reviewboardmods`` contains the server-side code that runs as
part of pushing reviews to the Mercurial server. This contains the
low-level code that maps commits to review requests and ensures Review
Board review state is in a sane state. This code is logically part of
the Mercurial server extension. However, it exists in its own directory
so it can eventually be leveraged by Git and so it has a license that
isn't the GPL (Review Board isn't GPL - Mercurial is).

``pylib/mozhg`` contains some Mercurial support APIs used by the
Mercurial integration. This includes code for finding Bugzilla
credentials.

Review Board Modifications
==========================

Review Request Extra Data
-------------------------

We store the following in the ``extra_data`` field of review requests:

p2rb
   String with value ``True``.

   The presence of this property differentiates review requests created
   by MozReview's special commit tracking code from ones created by
   vanilla Review Board. Many of our customizations to Review Board
   ignore review requests unless they have this annotation.

p2rb.is_squashed
   String with values ``True`` or ``False``.

   This property identifies whether this review request is a special
   *parent*/*squashed*/*tracking* review request.

   Since Review Board doesn't yet have the concept of multiple commits
   per review request, we needed to invent one. This property helps us
   distinguish the parent/tracking review request from its children.

p2rb.identifier
   String with user-supplied value.

   The value of this string groups multiple review requests belonging to
   the same logical review together. This property is defined on all
   our review requests and it should be the same for every review
   request tracked by a single *squashed*/*parent* review request.

p2rb.commits
   String of JSON serialization of an array of strings corresponding to
   review request IDs.

   This is set on *parent* review requests only.

   This array holds the list of review requests currently associated
   with this review request series.

p2rb.discard_on_publish_rids
   String of JSON serialization of an array of strings corresponding to
   review request IDs.

   This is set on *parent* review requests only.

   When drafts are created, sometimes extra review requests get created
   and associated with the *parent* review request but never actually
   get published (say you upload a commit by accident and then decide to
   remove it from review). There is no way to delete and recycle a
   review request, even if it has never been published. Instead, we
   track which review requests would become orphans. At publish time,
   we discard the drafts and review requests.

p2rb.unpublished_rids
   String of JSON serialization of an array of strings corresponding to
   review request IDs.

   This is set on *parent* review requests only.

   The list of review requests in this property tracks which review
   requests tracked by this *parent* review request should be published
   when the parent review request moves from *draft* to *published*
   state.

p2rb.commit_id
   String SHA-1 of the commit currently associated with this review
   request.


Running Tests
=============

The MozReview tests are all defined as part of the Mercurial extension.
To run the tests::

   $ ./run-tests -j2 hgext/reviewboard/tests/ autoland/tests/

There are also some Selenium-based tests.  You'll need Firefox
(release) installed to run them::

  $ ./run-tests pylib/mozreview/mozreview/tests/
