Interacting with Review Board
=============================

The web interface of MozReview is powered by
`Review Board <https://www.reviewboard.org/>`_. This article will talk a
little about how Review Board works and how we've customized it for
MozReview.

How Review Board Works
======================

Before we go on to describe how to use Review Board, it is important
to have a brief understanding of how Review Board works.

For the patient, a read of the
`Review Board User Guide <https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/manual/2.5/users/>`_
is recommended.

For the impatient, some terminology. Note that some of these terms
are specific to MozReview.

review request
   A request to review a single patch/diff/commit
review
   Responses to a review request
issue
   A component of a review that is explicitly tracked as part of the
   review request
review request series
   A collection of review requests all belonging to the same logical
   group
parent review request
   For review request series, the review request that tracks the
   overall state of the series. This is also known as the root review request.
draft
   Refers to a state review requests or reviews can be in where content
   is not publicly visible and is only available to the person who created
   it. All review requests and reviews start in the draft state by default.
publishing
   The act of taking a draft review request or draft review and marking
   it as public, making it visible to everybody
ship it
   This is the term used for *granting review* or *r+* in Bugzilla
   terminology.
review id
   A unique identifier identifying a review request series. This is
   commonly derived from a bug number and username.

Publishing Commits
==================

When you push commits to the review repository, review requests are
created in Review Board. As a refresher::

  $ hg push review
  pushing to ssh://reviewboard-hg.mozilla.org/gecko
  searching for changes
  remote: adding changesets
  remote: adding manifests
  remote: adding file changes
  remote: added 2 changesets with 2 changes to 2 files (+1 heads)
  remote: recorded push in pushlog
  submitting 2 changesets for review

  changeset:  227233:8943dd91f4c0
  summary:    Bug 448604 - Rewrite Firefox on top of Servo
  review:     https://reviewboard.mozilla.org/r/3361 (pending)

  changeset:  227234:5de956a4f2b5
  summary:    Bug 448604 - Remove all XUL usage
  review:     https://reviewboard.mozilla.org/r/3363 (pending)

  review id:  bz://448604/MattN
  review url: https://reviewboard.mozilla.org/r/3359 (pending)
  (visit review url to publish these review requests so others can see them)

The *pending* in the output says that the review requests are in an
unpublished *draft* state. In other words, only you can see the content
that has been uploaded to Review Board.

The first thing you should do is follow the final URL in the output -
the *review url*. You should see a page like the following:

.. image:: parent-unpublished.png

This is the parent (aka. root) review request. It is a special review request
that manages the state of all the *children* review requests.

The metadata on the parent review request is derived from the content of
commits you've pushed for review. You can see a list of commits and
their summary lines that are part of the review.

To publish the collection of review requests, you'll want to assign reviewers.

Each commit has **Reviewers** line that shows the reviewer(s) for the commit.

To edit reviewers, click the pencil icon to display an input box. Typing into
the input box will display results from Bugzilla's and Review Board's shared
user database. Here is what that looks like:

.. image:: select-reviewer.png

.. tip::

   The easiest way to find a reviewer is by IRC nickname. You should
   not need to type the leading colon that exists in Bugzilla.

Once you've selected the reviewers for a commit, click **OK** to stop editing
the field.

After you've selected a reviewer for each commit, your parent review request
will look something like the following:

.. image:: publish.png

At this time, you'll want to click the **Publish** button on the green
notification bar. This will start the process of publishing the reviews in
Review Board and updating Bugzilla to reflect that a review is
requested.

Reviewing Code
==============

So you've been asked to review something on Review Board. You've come
to the right place to learn.

Mozilla hasn't customized the review interface of Review Board
significantly. So, the
`Review Board User Guide <https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/manual/2.5/users/>`_,
particularly the section on
`Reviewing <https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/manual/2.5/users/reviews/>`_,
is almost completely applicable to MozReview!

We **highly** recommend reading the
`Reviewing <https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/manual/2.5/users/reviews/>`_
section of the Review Board User Guide before conducting review. When
reading, you may want to pay attention to the following, which may be
new concepts if you are coming from Bugzilla code reviews:

Advanced Diff Viewer and Commenting
   The diff viewing and commenting mechanism in Review Board is much
   more advanced compared to Bugzilla/Splinter.

   If the lines of context in a review are not sufficient, you can
   expand context right from the review interface (it just fetches the
   data from the underlying repository you pushed the commits too).

   Intra-line diffs are supported. This means if you only change a
   single character or line, that is clearly indicated.

   Whitespace differences can be shown or hidden dynamically from the
   interface.

   Review comments can be set over multiple lines, allowing reviewers
   to be clearer about where the comment applies.

   Interdiff (showing the diff between multiple versions of the diff)
   works.

`Issue Tracking <https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/manual/2.5/users/reviews/issue-tracking/>`_
   When writing comments on reviews, Review Board allows you to open an
   *Issue*.

   Issues are important comments that are explicitly tracked by
   Review Board.

   When you view a review request, a table of issues is presented. This
   allows reviewer and code author to track the progress of a review over
   multiple iterations.

`Markdown <https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/manual/2.5/users/markdown/>`_
   Review Board supports Markdown in many of its multi-line text fields.
   This includes review comments. Use the power responsibly.

Drafts and Published Reviews
   Review comments are in an unpublished *draft* state by default. You
   must explicitly click a **Publish Review** button for your review to
   be visible by others.

Conversion to Bugzilla Comments
   When reviews are published, their content is converted to text and
   posted to Bugzilla as a comment.

   (There is talk of changing this behavior because capturing the rich
   review interface in Bugzilla comments can be challenging and appears
   to offer little value over just going to Review Board and looking at
   the original comments there.)

Granting, Denying, Clearing, and Delegating Reviews
   There is a dropdown containing standard Bugzilla review flags
   (``r?``, ``r+``, and ``r-``) in the **Finish Review** dialog in
   each commit review request. The selected value will be set on the
   corresponding attachment in Bugzilla when the review is
   published. There is also a blank value, which will clear the review
   flag. Since each commit has an associated attachment with review
   flags in Bugzilla, they need to be reviewed separately.

   Note that, if a reviewer has previously left a ``r+`` or ``r-``
   review, or has cleared the review, resetting it to ``r?`` will
   cause the review flag in Bugzilla to be both set and directed to
   the reviewer, since a user cannot set a review flag as someone
   else. If the original ``r?`` has never been changed, then it will
   be left as is, i.e., set by the commit author.

   The list of reviewers can be modified by anyone with permission
   to change the attachment in Bugzilla; click on the edit/pencil icon
   next to the reviewer list and update the reviewers using their IRC
   nicks. Changes to the reviewer list need to be published using the
   **Publish** button on the green notification bar.

   While the parent review request (available from the **Review
   Summary** link on any commit review request) provides a collapsed
   view of all commits and can be useful to get a global view of the
   whole commit series, reviewers should generally not leave reviews
   on it. Correspondingly, the review-flag dropdown is disabled on
   parent review requests.

   There is currently no equivalent to ``feedback+``. This workflow is
   still being discussed.

Working With "Patches"
----------------------

   The review description field contains an url to pull down the commits
   under review. If you want to view the patch as plain text, import it
   into a mercurial queue, push it to another tree, etc. this is the way
   to go.

   To pull the commits down use the url provided in the review
   description, for instance, if the revision is ``foo``::

      $ hg pull -r foo https://reviewboard-hg.mozilla.org/gecko/

   Once it is pulled down you can bookmark it and update to it, which is the
   recommended way of working with patches::

      $ hg bookmark -r foo foo-review
      $ hg update foo-review

   Or if you still use mercurial queues, you can import it into a mercurial
   queue::

      $ hg qimport -r foo
      $ hg qapplied
      foo.patch

   To get plain text, just use ``hg export``::

      $ hg export -r foo-review > foo.patch

   or::

      $ hg export qtip > foo.patch

   Once you've finished with a patch, if you're using bookmarks you can just
   update to another bookmark and remove the review bookmark::

      $ hg update central
      $ hg bookmark --delete foo-review

   If you're using queues, you can pop it from your queue and then delete it::

      $ hg qpop
      $ hg qdelete foo.patch
